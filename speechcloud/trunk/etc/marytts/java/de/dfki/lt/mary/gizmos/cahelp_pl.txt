playleaf [which] [where] [value] or pl [which] [where] [value]

Renders all units from current leaf as audio.
which can be either "all" which takes no parameters (where and value
must therefore be empty) to play back all units of the leaf OR

"cut" which will play back the units with outliers seperated from
normal units.
Leave where and value empty to use the global variables for
outlier detection or 
where = "above"/"below" with value being some float cut value to
manually change the global variables and assume the outliers are
above/below the given value.

After hitting enter, you will be asked to choose between the two
wav patterns:
<normal units> <beep> <outliers> (yes) or
<outliers only> (no, default).

Note: When playing back all units, they are NOT (yet) sorted
by probability value.
Also note that the cutting mode "both" is not (yet) supported
and implemented for this command.
