load [filename] or
l [filename]

Load new cart from (binary) file filename,
discarding all changes made to current cart.
(Call save or dump before or, if you used the command
 analyze, remember that you can give a filename
 for automatic dumping, too.)
 
Note: keep track of the carts that you have!
      New cart will be the one you work with after
      having called load, so there might be more
      or fewer leafs, units etc.
Note also that you can load "normal" .mry carts with this command,
you will still be able to listen to the leafs, display the decision
paths and the candidates. But of course, with all means and sds being
0.0, you won't be able to detect or erase any outliers.
