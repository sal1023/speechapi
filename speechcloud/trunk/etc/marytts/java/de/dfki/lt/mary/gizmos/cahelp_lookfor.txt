lookfor [unit]

Returns the index of the leaf that contains as
one of its candidates the unit with index [unit].

Since we are examining a cart, each unit belongs
to one leaf only.
Note: not that useful, except perhaps you want to
      whether your cutting or erasing operation(s)
      have succeeded,
      In this case you can call this method to 
      look for a unit that you had erased, if it
      says it's still there, something must have
      gone wrong.
