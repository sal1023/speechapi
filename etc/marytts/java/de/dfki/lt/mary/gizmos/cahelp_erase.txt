erase [uindex1].. [uindexN] or
e [uindex1].. [uindexN]

Delete as many units as you want from the cart
each with their respective unit index [uindex].

Note: With this method you may erase any unit(s)
      you want, independant from the current leaf.
      That is why this method is called "erasing"
      instead of "cutting" as in the analyze method,
      since the cutting part is leaf-dependant.
      (And at least semi-automatic.)
