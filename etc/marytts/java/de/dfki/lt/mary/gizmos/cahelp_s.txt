save [filename] or
s [filename]

Dump current cart in (binary) (CA) file filename.

Please note that save != dump:

Dump = save current tree to MARY format, therefore
       replacing the float p-values with constant
       int 0s; rendering the resulting cart more
       or less useless for the program
       (It will still be useful for everything
       that doesn't involve the floats, though.)
       
Save = save current tree to CA format, therefore
       leaving the floats intact; allowing for 
       future CA work on it
       
Note: you might not want to call it "cart.mry"!
