viewleaf [index] [which] or
vl [index] [which]

Displays all candidates of leaf with index [index].
Again, [index] is optional, if not specified,
the current leaf is used.
[which] is a String parameter, either
"all" if all units should be displayed or
"out" for outliers only (given the cut mode and values).

Note: Like playleaf, viewleaf jumps to the leaf
      if index != current leaf index.
