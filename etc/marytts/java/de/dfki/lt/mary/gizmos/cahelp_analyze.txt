There are 3 parameters for the analyze command:

[mode] which can be "user" or "auto";
       use "resume" if you want to continue your work on last
       "user" session
[logfile] in which all of the results will be logged in
[cartfile] the file in which the (binary) final cart will be stored in

The 3 modes are:
user
  This mode is the most important one as it combines some automatic
  features with complete user control.
  "Useless" leafs are automatically skipped;
  (i.e. there are less than two candidates, or the standard deviation
   of the p-values is 0)
  "interesting" leafs can be viewed, played back as audio and they
  can be cut according to the cut mode and values which 
  can be changed by the user, too.
  In every case, data is displayed and stored in the logfile
  along the way.
  
  resume
    As this one belongs to the "user" mode, it allows you to resume
    your earlier work. It doesn't need any parameters, since logfile
    and cartfile are stored in the already saved file "resume.dat".
    Thus, just type "a resume".

auto
  In this mode, you just have to punch in some data for the algorithm
  and let the algorithm do its job.
  Just like the user mode, the auto mode also skips the useless leafs
  and just analyzes the interesting ones.
  You may even choose whether you DO want to cut the outliers (y) or
  just pretend and look up the log afterwards (default).
  Note: Don't walk away from the computer as it usually takes just 
  less than a second to finish!
